## CSV TO JSON

Clone this repo or download the project as a zip (and unzip it). Go to the project with the command line to get started.

## Getting started

First, you'll need to start your server. You do this by running `npm install` followed by `npm start` in the root of your project.

Now that the server is up and running, you need to start the actual app. Go to the `client` folder and run `npm install` followed by `npm start`.

This will start your app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), which you will be taken to automatically.

Now that your app and server are running, we can continue to the next step.

Keep in mind that the app and server have to run simultaneously at all times for the app to work.


## How to use

You will see an upload button at the top of the screen. Press that button and you will be asked to upload a CSV file. 

Upload your desired CSV file and a table with the contents of your CSV, as well as the title of your file, will be rendered on screen.
